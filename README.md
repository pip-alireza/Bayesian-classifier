Classification using Naive Bayes

Please run py_nb. Then the algorithm asks for a file for training.  
You may use your data or you wish to use the test data provided here.     
After training, it asks for a name to save the trained network.      
Then you can load a trained model and use it to cross-validate a test dataset.     
In the end, it asks if you wish to enter your manual input for prediction.
